# ODI Men's Cricket Match Data (2002-2023) Win Probability Predictor using Machine Learning (ML Regression models)

This is one of the Machine Learning (ML) Regression project. Here we are using real time [Kaggle's dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utkarshtomar736/odi-mens-cricket-match-data-2002-2023
) of ODI Men's Cricket data to find and predict the win probability for the second
innings of the different teams. We are first using sklearn's OnehotEncoder to convert categorical data into numerical data and then training our ML model using different 
different Machine learning (ML) algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest Regression and etc.
